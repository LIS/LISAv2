# This script verifies XDP Action - TX or DROP
# For DROP/ABORTED Action verification script will compare number of ping packets
#		lossed before XDP DROP/ABORTED action and after XDP DROP/ABORTED action
# For TX Action verification script will start ping on server and measure the packets captured by tcpdump
#		Expected result: 0 packets should be captured by tcpdump after TX action as this action
#		will return all ping packets to sender at hardware level
