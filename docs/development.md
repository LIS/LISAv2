what to expect of it), as well as our design and development philosophy.

## Environment Setup

Follow the [installation](install.md) steps to prepare the source code. Then
follow the steps below to set up the corresponding development environment.

### Visual Studio Code

1. Click on the Python version at the bottom left of the editor's window and
   select the Python interpreter which Poetry just created. If you do not find
   it, check [FAQ and troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for extra
   instructions. This step is important because it ensures the current workspace
   uses the correct Poetry virtual environment.

1. You can copy the settings below into `.vscode/settings.json`.

    ```json
    {
        "markdown.extension.toc.levels": "2..6",
        "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "strict",
        "python.formatting.provider": "black",
        "python.linting.enabled": true,
        "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
        "python.linting.mypyEnabled": true,
        "python.linting.pylintEnabled": false,
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "python.linting.mypyArgs": [
            "--strict",
            "--namespace-packages",
            "--implicit-reexport",
            "--show-column-numbers"
        ],
        "python.sortImports.path": "isort",
        "python.analysis.useLibraryCodeForTypes": false,
        "python.analysis.autoImportCompletions": false,
        "files.eol": "\n",
        "terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
            "mypypath": "${workspaceFolder}\\typings"
        },
        "python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides": {
            "reportUntypedClassDecorator": "none",
            "reportUnknownMemberType": "none",
            "reportGeneralTypeIssues": "none",
            "reportUnknownVariableType": "none",
            "reportUnknownArgumentType": "none",
            "reportUnknownParameterType": "none",
            "reportUnboundVariable": "none",
            "reportPrivateUsage": "none",
            "reportImportCycles": "none",
            "reportUnnecessaryIsInstance": "none",
        },
        "python.languageServer": "Pylance",
        "markdown.extension.toc.levels": "2..6",
    }
    ```

1. Install extensions.

   - Install
     [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
     to get best code intelligence experience.
   - Install
     [Rewrap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap)
     to automatically wrap.
   - If there is need to update the documentation, it is recommended to install
     [Markdown All in
     One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one).
     It helps to maintain the table of contents in the documentation.

### Emacs

Use the [pyvenv](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/pyvenv) package:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package pyvenv
  :ensure t
  :hook (python-mode . pyvenv-tracking-mode))
```

Then run `M-x add-dir-local-variable RET python-mode RET pyvenv-activate RET
<path/to/virtualenv>` where the value is the path given by the command above.
This will create a `.dir-locals.el` file as follows:

```emacs-lisp
;;; Directory Local Variables
;;; For more information see (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

((python-mode . ((pyvenv-activate . "~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/lisa-s7Q404Ij-py3.8"))))
```

### Other setups

- Install and enable [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) to
  find bash errors locally.

## Code guideline

### Naming Conventions

Please read the [naming
conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)
section of PEP 8, which explains the meaning of each of the styles. A brief
overview of the most important parts:

- Modules (and files) should use lowercase short names.
- Class (and exception) names should use the `CapWords` convention (also known
  as `CamelCase`)
- Function and variable names should use lowercase letters, and words should be
  separated by underscores to improve readability (also called `snake_case`).
- To avoid conflicts with the standard library, you can add an underscore, such
  as `id_`.
- Leading lines such as `_data` apply to non-public methods and instance
  variables. Subclasses can use it. If you don't use it in a subclass, use it
  like `__data` in a superclass.
- If there is a pair of `get_x` and `set_x` methods without additional
  parameters, please use the built-in `@property` decorator to convert them to
  properties.
- Constants should be similar to `CAPITALIZED_SNAKE_CASE`.
- When importing a function, try to avoid renaming it with `import as` because
  it introduces cognitive overhead to keep track of another name. If the name
  conflicts, please use the package name as the namespace, such as `import
  schema`, and use it as `schema.Node`.

If in doubt, follow existing conventions or check the style guide.

### Code checks

If the development environment is set up correctly, the following tools will
automatically check the code. If there is any problem with the development
environment settings, please feel free to submit an issue to us or create a pull
request for repair. You can also run the check manually.

- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black), the opinionated code formatter resolves
  all disputes about how to format our Python files. This will become clearer
  after following [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (official
  Python style guide).
- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) (and integrations), the semantic
  analyzer, used to coordinate most other tools.
- [isort](https://timothycrosley.github.io/isort/), the `import` sorter, it will
  automatically divide the import into the expected alphabetical order.
- [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/), the static type checker, which allows us to
  find potential errors by annotating and checking types.
- [rope](https://github.com/python-rope/rope), provides completion and renaming
  support for pyls.
